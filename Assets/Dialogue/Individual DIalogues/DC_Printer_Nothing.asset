  - You open the scanner, put nothing in it, and close it. You then hit the scan
    button. The machine makes a noise, a light flashes against nothingness, and then,

  - "...Oh wait? You literally didn\u2019t want to print anything? Oh, why didn\u2019t
    you say so, ink wouldn\u2019t have been wasted. Unless you were using this as
    a distraction- oh my gosh you\u2019re still procrastinating."
  - How sad.
