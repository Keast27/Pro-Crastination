  - "Rob is doing his best. You mumble to yourself \u201CGosh, Rob has everything- 
    an unwrinkled shirt, a wife, a car, a house, stunning hair, sharp jawline, chiseled
    cheekbone\u201D, you think he has it all."
  - "Meanwhile, upon examining those last few things, you might be a little gay for
    Rob? If you\u2019re going to put off your work, maybe you should do some soul
    searching."
