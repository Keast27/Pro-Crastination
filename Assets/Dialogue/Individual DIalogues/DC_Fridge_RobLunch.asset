  - "You take the pretentious blond\u2019s lunch out and examine it. It\u2019s chicken
    parm made by his loving wife, Lisa. Lisa and Rob are struggling with their marriage
    because the two are always busy. Rob tries to get work done early, but it seems
    like he\u2019s always forced to pick up some other guy\u2019s slack. I wonder
    who that person is"
  - "Anyways, Rob and Lisa are still trying. This chicken parm is Rob\u2019s favorite
    dish, and makes him think about his dear wife."
  - You eat the chicken parm.
