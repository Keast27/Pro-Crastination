  sentences:
  - "Cathy\u2019s lunch consists of a vegetarian wrap. Ugh, vegetarian and their
    lack of meat. How annoying. Thinking they\u2019re better than us because they
    don\u2019t murder animals for food. Plants have feelings too you heartless monsters.
    Maybe being vegetarian wouldn\u2019t be that bad if Cathy weren\u2019t so annoying."
  - You eat the sad wrap. The wrap is almost as sad as you.
