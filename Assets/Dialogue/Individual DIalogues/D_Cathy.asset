  - Dear lord, why would you talk to-
  - "Cathy: Hey, how\u2019s it going! You look nice today! Did you watch the news?
    Did you hear that a horse is LOOSE in a HOSPITAL?! Crazy right, wonder who let
    him in. OH! I just got an update on my phone- the horse knows how to use the
    elevator?! That\u2019s cray!! Anyways, I\u2019ve been on a vegetarian diet lately.
    This wasn\u2019t something I decided to do by choice, rather, I went camping
    with my fiance and got a tick. I sent it in for testing to see if it has a disease
    or not, but I haven\u2019t gotten the results yet. To play it safe I chose to
    go vegetarian because I heard that there are ticks going around with a disease
    that makes you allergic to red meat. You know how tragic that is? Not being able
    to eat bacon? I mean, bacon is mostly fat though so maybe this change of diet
    will help me. Maybe I can lose a little extra weight from this. Maybe I should
    get my fiance to join me- Maybe you should join me! Yeah! Let\u2019s not eat
    red meat! Hank Red did say that vegetarians were right, it\u2019s just not the
    lifestyle for him. Maybe this is a new opportunity for me! PETA exists for a
    reason right! Yeah, those animals are treated poorly, if they\u2019re going to
    die, we need to find better ways to kill the animals- that\u2019s the cause right?
    Oh wait, no, animals have feelings and emotions! We can\u2019t kill them, that\u2019s
    really ridiculous! Hey, we should start protesting, right now, yeah let\u2019s
    do it- wiat we need planning, and time, and a committee, wait, what are we protesting
    again?"
