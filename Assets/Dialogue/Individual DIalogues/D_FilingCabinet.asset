  sentences:
  - You throw open one of the drawers of the filing cabinet. In the drawers you see
    hundreds of papers and folders- past work from other, hard working employees.
  - "You grab a file and glance through its contents. It\u2019s full of graphs and
    charts from an old project. You almost feel like it\u2019s something you can
    use for your project."
