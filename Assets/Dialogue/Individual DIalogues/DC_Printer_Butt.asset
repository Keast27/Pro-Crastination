  sentences:
  - "You\u2019re an adult in your late twenties. It\u2019s important to state that
    before commencing in narrating this god awful forsaken task you are about to
    do. I just really think you should know that you are an adult with a job."
  - You shamelessly pull down your pants and put your other pair of cheeks on the
    screen. The scanner goes and does its job. Did you even think to ask the scanners
    consent you sick freak?
  - Once the scanner finishes you hop down, pull your pants up, and watch as it prints
    an image of your buttocks.
  - "Have you been amused? Are you proud of yourself? Of your life, job, do you hate
    it all? Is that why you won\u2019t go back to work? I don\u2019t get paid enough
    for this."
